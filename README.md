## Pre Requisites
### First Steps üìã
When you download or clone this repository, the first thing you should do is run the following command in the direction of the project
```
composer install
```
### Migrations ‚öôÔ∏è
Then you must take into account the configuration of the DB in the .env file. Then you should create a migration with the following command:
```
php artisan migrate
```
You should also take into account other existing commands if you modify or eliminate something from the migrations:
```
php artisan migrate:rollback
php artisan migrate
```
And you are ready to start the Android app, but first you should be sure to open your command console and type the following command
```
ipconfig
```
Once you are clear about what IP your computer is using, you should go to the terminal and go to the backend folder, and then execute the following

```
php -S (YOUR_IP):8000 -t public
```
Now you should go to the IRetroFit file and ServiceSingleton to modify the ip previously established by me to yours

## Enlaza Project Prototype

I describe this section in its corresponding repository, https://github.com/JavierMedina11/Prototipo-ProyectoEnlaza

## Technology Stack
The technology stack is divided into the following technologies:

* **Backend:** PHP 7 / Laravel Framework
* **Microservicio:** Lumen Framework
* **BBDD:** MySQL
* **Frontend:** Android Kotlin

## Repositories

The repositories we find this same one and that of https://github.com/JavierMedina11/Prototerapia-ProyectoEnlaza

## Planification

The planning of the app, I have had to do it on the fly, that is, since I obtained the information from the company with such a delay, I have had to make an effort to try to do everything in a period of three or three and a half weeks.

## Conclusions and opinions

My final conclusion regarding the project is that it has not been easy, since when working with a technological stack in which I had no experience, especially, not so much the backend (Laravel & Lumen), but Android Studio based on Kotlin which is the one that made up the Frontend, it has not been a mild experience, especially when we get to the delivery date and in which the pressure increases even more, although, I would like to highlight that based on blows and despair, my Confidence in my abilities may have improved a bit, although, due to the short period of time at work, I have not been able to implement everything that I would like, which leaves me with a small feeling of discomfort and unease.
